\chapter{Introduction}

% Why is this inquiry important in the first place?

% Why Being and Nothingness?

% What is the most exciting thing about Sartre's Being and Nothingness?

% This paragraph essentially answers the question of "Why is metaphysics important?"

What is \emph{being?} \textquote{Why are there beings at all, instead of nothing?} That was the question, presented in the words of Martin Heidegger, as the \emph{fundamental question of metaphysics} \autocite[1]{Heidegger}. The question of being is both the broadest question, as well as the deepest -- those answer must account both for \textcquote[4]{Heidegger}{some elephant in a jungle in India, just as much as some chemical oxidation process\footnote{First published in 1935, Martin Heidegger's astronomical quip predated the Viking lander (and any practical investigations into the being of Martian surface chemistry) by more than 41 years.} on the planet Mars.} Our ability to give an adequate account of being is important, not just on the basis of some abstract, theoretical desire, but as a practical necessity too -- for to understand the being of a human, is to know what is the \textcquote[11]{Aristotle}{characteristic activity} of a human-being. Hence, as Physics is to Mechanics, so is Metaphysics to Philosophy -- the understanding of the axioms of the former will allow us to derive the facts of the latter. Thus, there is a necessity for Metaphysics, should we hope to understand the entirety of human-reality -- just as how there is a necessity for Physics to understand the entirety of the empirical world.

% The next paragraph essentially answers the question of "Why is Sartre's Metaphysics a good explanation, as opposed to Kant or anyone else?"

% Now we present the question of contingency, that comes from Sartre's ontology

% Explain briefly how the question of contingency comes from nothingness-- hence in order for us to explore this question properly, we need to first understand where nothingness comes from 

% Begin an explanation of the genesis of contingency from nothingness, using a physical analogy of Cosmogony.
