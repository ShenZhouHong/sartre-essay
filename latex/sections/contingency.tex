\chapter{The Contingency of Human Existence}

% Be Goddamned passionate. This is the **KNIFE'S EDGE** of your thesis
% Talk about love.
% Getting out early what's at stake.
% The paradox: without contingency, we would be things. But WITH contingency, love and teleos becomes bleak.

We are contingent beings. This is the fundamental ontology of the human existence, the metaphysics of our humanity. A human being is no more than a being-for-itself, cloaked in the flimsy body of its own facticity. Our being is defined by our \emph{ontological act}, the constant fleeing of our for-itself away from the in-itself of facticity. Why are we contingent? What is the meaning of this contingency? What is at stake here, when our human-existence is defined by our own nothingness, which haunts us in every step we take? Our contingency is like a curse, a hidden unravelling. Unlike the perfect adequation of the being-in-itself, we can \emph{never} hope to coincide with our being, to truly \emph{be} in-itself. We all contain the poisonous seed of negation, the question of our own being. This uneasiness manifests itself as the phenomena of \emph{anguish}, which Sartre dissects and presents to us, with all the cold certainty of a tumour at the hands of a pathologist. For what is anguish, other than a deep, visceral acknowledgement, of the contingency of our being?

% Talk about anguish as an introduction to the bad part of our contingency

% Segue into talking about freedom, and how freedom arises from our contingency since we do not have a fixed being.

% Talk about the bad part of freedom, and then transition into talking about concrete relations w/ the Other

% In talking about Other, talk about love, and the paradox of it

% Make sure to remember to talk about the following concept: the 'ontological-complexity' of a metaphysics. Where there is roughly a balance to be had between solipsism, and nihilism, but a complex array of options between the two which defines ontological complexity:
% 
% Solipsism - the ontology is too simple, all is reduced to one
% Finite ontology - the ontology of chess and checkers, a finite universe.
% Deterministic ontology -- the ontological complexity expands at a constant rate
% A Free ontology - the ontology expands non-linearly, but just right -- there is freedom
% Nihilism - the ontology is too general, there is no being at all

% Talk about how we are different from the Greek Gods
