\chapter{The Contingency of Human Existence}

% Make sure to remember to talk about the following concept: the 'ontological-complexity' of a metaphysics. Where there is roughly a balance to be had between solipsism, and nihilism, but a complex array of options between the two which defines ontological complexity:
% 
% Solipsism - the ontology is too simple, all is reduced to one
% Finite ontology - the ontology of chess and checkers, a finite universe.
% Deterministic ontology -- the ontological complexity expands at a constant rate
% A Free ontology - the ontology expands non-linearly, but just right -- there is freedom
% Nihilism - the ontology is too general, there is no being at all

% Be FUCKING passionate. This is the **KNIFE'S EDGE** of your thesis

% Talk about love.

% Getting out early what's at stake.

% The paradox: without contingency, we would be things. But WITH contingency, love and teleos becomes bleak.
